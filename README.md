# ✉️ Free the Devs – OpenAI Developer Platform Request

**No more gatekeepers. No more silence. Let devs build freely.**

This repository contains a letter sent to OpenAI requesting the creation (or support) of a **developer-first app platform** — one built for indie devs, solo builders, small teams, and creators who’ve been locked out by billion-dollar app stores.

---

## 📢 What This Is

We’re independent developers who are:

- Frustrated with $99 paywalls just to test an app  
- Tired of 30% revenue cuts for basic distribution  
- Shut down by vague app rejections  
- Overlooked by stores that only reward VC-backed startups

We’re not anti-security. We’re pro-transparency, pro-fairness, and pro-innovation.

We believe **OpenAI** is in a unique position to build a secure, AI-powered, dev-first ecosystem that:

✅ Uses transparent, AI-assisted policy validation  
✅ Helps solo devs launch without being buried in fees  
✅ Encourages creativity, not compliance  
✅ Makes monetization and visibility accessible to everyone

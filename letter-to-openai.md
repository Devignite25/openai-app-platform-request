# An Open Letter to OpenAI

## A Call for a Fair, Developerâ€‘First AI App Platform

Dear OpenAI,

We write to you not as competitors, but as independent developers, solo creators, and startup builders who believe in the future of AIâ€”but are currently locked out of that future.

The current app distribution model, dominated by monopolistic platforms, is broken. Developers are subject to arbitrary rules, outrageous 30% fees, algorithmic suppression, and exploitative policies that crush creativity and innovation.

We believe OpenAI is uniquely positioned to change this.

Youâ€™ve built some of the most powerful technology of our generationâ€”tools that can empower creators and transform industries. But right now, weâ€™re still forced to deploy those tools inside systems designed to profit off us, not support us.

It doesnâ€™t have to be this way.

## Weâ€™re Calling On You to Build a Developerâ€‘First Platform

A platform that gives indie developers and creators a **fair, transparent, and sustainable path to reach users**, powered by OpenAIâ€™s technologyâ€”but free from the stranglehold of app store gatekeepers.

Hereâ€™s what weâ€™re asking for:

- âœ… **Fair Revenue Sharing:** Cap platform fees at 5â€“10%, not the industry-standard 30%.
- âœ… **Transparent Policies:** Publish clear, consistent rules that developers can trustâ€”and involve the community in shaping them.
- âœ… **Open Distribution:** Let users discover, install, and interact with apps outside walled gardens.
- âœ… **Developer-First Design:** Build APIs, tooling, and support systems that empower creatorsâ€”not just enterprise partners.
- âœ… **Community Governance:** Let us help shape the future with representation, voting mechanisms, and feedback loops.
- âœ… **AI-Powered Innovation:** Use your models to supercharge our creativityâ€”not replace it.
- âœ… **Global Accessibility:** Ensure builders from every country and background have equal opportunity.

## Why This Matters

The AI revolution must not become another tool of corporate gatekeeping. If we continue down the current path, we risk repeating the same mistakes of the mobile eraâ€”where the most creative apps never see the light of day because distribution is rigged.

But if OpenAI leads with a bold, developer-first approach, you wonâ€™t just win developer trustâ€”youâ€™ll ignite a wave of innovation that changes the world.

## Weâ€™re Ready to Help

This campaign is not just a demand. Itâ€™s a movement.

Weâ€™re organizing builders around the world to sign this letter, share our stories, and build a future that works for everyone. We want to partner with you to shape a platform that is open, ethical, and revolutionary.

Together, we can free the devsâ€”and build something better.

Sincerely,  
**The Independent Developer Community**

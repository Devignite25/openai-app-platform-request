**Subject:** Request for a Developer-First App Platform Backed by OpenAI

---

Dear OpenAI Team,

I'm writing to you as one of many independent developers who believe it's time for a change.

Today, launching a mobile or web app means navigating a minefield of gatekeepers:
- $99 developer fees before you can even test your app
- 30% revenue cuts from platforms that offer little support
- Vague, inconsistent app rejection policies
- Limited visibility and discoverability for small creators
- No centralized space for secure, fair app publishing â€” especially for solo or indie devs

Weâ€™re not asking for a lawless platform. We support clear policies, privacy standards, and security reviews.

What we need is **a platform that empowers creators** â€” not punishes them.

We believe OpenAI is uniquely positioned to help build (or back) a modern, AI-assisted app ecosystem that could include:
- AI-powered, transparent policy enforcement and security checks
- Developer-first support tools and real guidance
- Lower or optional fees for indie developers
- Discoverability thatâ€™s algorithmic, not paywalled
- App publishing without gatekeepers â€” open to individuals, not just corporations

Weâ€™re calling it **#FreeTheDevs**, and we hope youâ€™ll consider this movement as something worth championing.

Youâ€™ve already given developers world-class tools. Now weâ€™re asking for the **freedom to share what we create.**

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]  
[Optional: Your Handle or Link to App/Project]  
A proud independent developer
